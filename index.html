            <h2>Christmas Cactus</h2>
         <p>The Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera bridgesii) blooms for a long time indoors with some of the most exotic-looking flowers in the plant kingdom. This cactus is a very popular plant, but most people are not aware of its special needs. Not all cacti are native to arid desert climates and require infrequent, sparse watering. The Christmas cactus actually calls the tropical rain forest home, and thus needs watering when the top inch of soil in the container feels dry to the touch.</p>

         <h2>Purple Heart </h2>
         <p>Purple heart (Tradescantia pallida) is aptly named, because its iconic purple stems grow beautiful blooms that range from violet to pink. However, despite its unique blooms, many gardeners choose this plant for its foliage, which is particularly vibrant. Both the stems and upper surfaces of the leaves appear to be deep royal purple but may also contain lighter shades of turquoise-gray that become darker as the foliage grows older. A plant will bloom with three-petaled pink flowers in small clusters throughout the warm season.</p>

         <h2>Spider Plant </h2>
         <p>The spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum) is considered one of the most adaptable of houseplants and the easiest to grow. This plant can grow in a wide range of conditions and suffers from few problems, other than brown tips. The spider plant is so named because of its spider-like plants, or spiderettes, which dangle down from the mother plant like spiders on a web. Available in green or variegated varieties, these spiderettes often start out as small white flowers.</p>
